# Recommendationss
This project demonstrates the implementation of a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering with the Surprise lib. By comparing various models (SVD, KNNBasic, KNNWithMeans, KNNWithZScore, and KNNBaseline) and fine-tuning the best model through grid search, we achieved an optimized recommendation engine. The SVD model, with the lowest RMSE score of 0.856, provided the best performance. Visualizations of rating distributions and personalized top-N movie recommendations offer clear insights into user preferences. This system effectively recommends movies to users based on their historical ratings, enhancing their movie-watching experience.

# Methodology
The project follows these steps:
1.)Preprocess Data
2.)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.)Build and Train Models
4.)Evaluate and Select the Best Model
5.)Generate Recommendations
6.)Visualize Recommendations

# Data
I took the datasets from kaggle. Included them in files as well
